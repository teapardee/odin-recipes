    <h3>Decription</h3>
        <p>This pesto pizza recipe is better than take-out and comes together in <strong>less than 20 minutes</strong>! Use refrigerated pizza dough from the store or my quick and easy pizza dough recipe along with all those ripe tomatoes and overgrown basil from the garden!
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza Crust</li>
            <li>Fresh Pesto</li>
            <li>Mozzarella Chees</li>
            <li>Fresh Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fresh Basil</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll dough out into a 12-14 inch crust. Transfer to a pizza pan (I HIGHLY recommend this one). Poke the crust all over with a fork and brush with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Par-bake crust for 3-5 minutes. See how nice and golden brown this pan helps the crust get?! If there is one pan you invest in - let it be this one! Also - it's actually super inexpensive so it's worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>While the crust is par-baking, throw together my super easy basil pesto (which can be made with pine nuts or walnuts)!</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and spread pesto across the crust, leaving about an inch around the perimeter.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly across the pizza.</li>
            <li>Place tomatoes on top of the cheese. Sprinkle oregano across the pizza as well as a large pinch of Kosher salt. Brush crust with more olive oil. </li>
            <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the crust is dark golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
