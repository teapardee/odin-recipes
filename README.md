Odin Recipe Project:

This project helped reinforece the following HTML & GIT lessons:

- Use of HTML Boilerplate
- Formatting of text & lists
- Use of anchor and image tags
- Linking multiple pages together
- Saving iterations using GIT, making proper commit subject lines

Personally, I found this lesson help my build my confidence with git & command line. I knew basic HTML prior to starting this course but never felt I had a comprehensive understanding of command line/git and how to use them properly. In this project I was able to use the command line to create files & directories, stage files, add commit messages and push to GitHub.
